1. What data types do each of these values represent?
"A Clockwork Orange" - string
42 -  integer
09/02/1945  - date
98.7 - float
$15.99 - float

2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.
Databases allow data to persist beyond the end of an application process. It also allows multiple applications to use the same data
and update it in real-time.

A text file is used when you don't want to retain the changes made during the program run i.e., whenever the program is run,
only the initial data saved on the file is available; any additions, deletions, changes from previous run are not recorded.
It also doesn't support multiple users to simultaneously work on the same file.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
SQL is a declarative programming language meaning you only need to tell it what you are looking for (the result/goal),
there is no need to provide step-by-step algorithm on how to find it. SQL behind the scenes will take care of that.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
Applications use databases to create/retrieve/update/delete application data. In real-life applications, there are multiple simultaneous
users that use the same data(subject to authorization and authentication) and for an application to make sense, it is important that the
data persists well beyond these individual sessions and to allow simultaneous edits to data.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
Table - collection of records - e.g., a table holding customer data of multiple customers
row -  an individual record - e.g., information related to one particular customer
column - information related to one attribute - e.g., email in a customer table holds customer email information
value - individual information - e.g., sam@abc.com is a value for email attribute

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.
char, varchar, date, number

7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

     SELECT date, amount          //selects two columns - date and amount - from the payments table
     FROM payments;

     SELECT amount                //retrieves all amounts greater than 500 from the payments table
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;

     SELECT *                     //retrieves all records from payments table where payee is Mega Foods
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';


8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

a. The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

SELECT email, signup FROM users
WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

email: datad@comcast.net; signup: 2008-01-20T00:00:00.000Z

b. The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.
SELECT userid FROM users
WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';

userid: 1

c. All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE userid = 4;

userid: 4; name: Brandy Boolean; email: bboolean@nasa.gov; signup: 1999-10-15T00:00:00.000Z
