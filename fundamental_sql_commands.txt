1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.
INSERT INTO employee(first, last, age, city, state)
VALUES ('Luke', 'Duke', 45, 'Atlanta', 'Georgia');

UPDATE employee SET age = 46
WHERE last = 'Duke';

DELETE FROM employee
WHERE first = 'Luke';


2. Explain the structure for each type of command.
INSERT INTO:
Insert into the table 'employee' values for columns 'first', 'last', 'age', 'city', and 'state'. The values should rightly match the
column names otherwise this might lead to bad data, as SQL generates an error only if the datatypes don't match.

UPDATE:
Update age to 46 in the employee table, where last name of the record/tuple matches 'Duke'.

DELETE:
Delete the records from the employee table that match the first name criteria of 'Luke'.

3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.
char(size) - Holds a fixed length string, with fixed size identified in the parenthesis, e.g., to indicate the state VA, NY, etc.
varchar(size) - Holds a variable length string, with maximum size identified in the parenthesis. e.g., name, address
date - holds date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. e.g., 1998-10-23
time - holds time in the format HH:MM:SS. e.g., 10:59:30.9999
datetime() - holds a combination of date and time. Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS. e.g., 1998-10-23 1:45:37.123
timestamp() - holds timestamp value, which records the number of seconds since the unix epoch. Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS.
e.g., to record the time a data entry was created.
boolean - for integers that can be 0 or 1.
int or integer - stores integers. e.g., IDs in a table
smallint - stores integers, with smaller range
numeric(p,s) - where p (precision) denotes total number of digits to the left and right of decimal point together,
where as s(scale) denotes the number of digits to the right of the decimal point, e.g., account balance

4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names,
whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

a. Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
    First and last name - varchar(15)
    Whether they sent in their RSVP - boolean
    Number of guests - integer
    Number of meals - numeric(5, 2)
b. Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.
CREATE TABLE wedding(
    first_name varchar(15),
    last_name varchar(15),
    guest_number integer,
    meal_count numeric(4, 1)
);

c. Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.
ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN card_count integer SET DEFAULT 0;

d. You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals
from the wedding table.
ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN meal_count;

e. The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.
ALTER TABLE wedding ADD COLUMN table_number integer;

f. The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.
ALTER TABLE wedding DROP COLUMN table_number;

5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date,
number of copies, and available copies.
CREATE TABLE library(
  ISBN bigint,
  title varchar(40),
  author varchar(40),
  genre varchar(15),
  publishing_date date,
  copies integer,
  available_copies integer
);

a. Find three books and add their information to the table.
INSERT INTO library(ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing_date, copies, available_copies)
VALUES (9780385376716, 'The Wonderful Things You Will Be', 'Emily Winfield Martin', 'childrens book', '2015-08-25', 10, 3),
(9781582701707, 'The Secret', 'Rhonda Byrne', 'Self-help', '2006-11-26', 12, 2),
(9781426307935, 'NG Little Kids First Big Book of Why', 'Amy Shields', 'childrens book', '2011-05-10', 5, 1);

b. Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.
UPDATE library
SET available_copies = available_copies-1
WHERE ISBN = 9781582701707;

c. Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.
DELETE FROM library
WHERE ISBN = 9781426307935;

6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin,
a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. In addition to
the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

CREATE TABLE spacecraft(
  id integer,
  name varchar(25),
  launch_year integer,
  origin_country varchar(50),
  description varchar(150),
  oribiting_body varchar(20),
  operating_status boolean,
  miles_from_earth bigint
);

a. Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.
INSERT INTO spacecraft(id, name, launch_year, origin_country, description, oribiting_body, operating_status, miles_from_earth)
VALUES
(1234, 'Voyager 2', 1977, 'United States of America', 'Study outer planets', 'none', true, 8.70E+09),
(2245, 'Mangalyaan', 2013, 'India', 'Study outer planets', 'none', true, 9.50E+09),
(3451, 'Helios', 1976, 'West Germany and United States of America', 'To study solar processes', 'dummy', true, 2.70E+07);

b. Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.
DELETE FROM spacecraft
WHERE id = 3451;

c. Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.
UPDATE spacecraft
SET operating_status = false
WHERE id = 1234;

7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line,
the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of
the email chain it's in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

CREATE TABLE inbox(
  id bigint,
  subject varchar(60),
  sender varchar(40),
  additional_recipients varchar(200),
  body varchar(500),
  time timestamp,
  read_status boolean,
  email_chain_id integer
);

a. Add three new emails to the inbox.
INSERT INTO inbox(id, subject, sender, additional_recipients, body, time, read_status, email_chain_id)
VALUES(12, 'Hello there!', 'aggie@gmail.com', 'sandra@gmail.com, ted@gmail.com', 'how are you doing?', now(), true, 1),
(23, 'Good evening', 'ss@gmail.com', 'george@gmail.com', 'dummy', now(), false, 11),
(7, 'Hello World!', 'john@gmail.com', 'peter@gmail.com', 'how are you all?', now(), true, 4);

b. You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
DELETE FROM inbox
WHERE id=7;

c. You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash,
so you can come back and read it later.
UPDATE inbox
SET read_status = false
WHERE id = 12;
